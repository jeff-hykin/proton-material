# proton-material
This is the css that fixes a lot (but certianly not all) of the issues I found with the https://github.com/Snoobyx/protonmail-material-themes

When I get time to well-document these changes I will likely post a request on Snoobyx repo and delete this.

Some changes include
- better handling of smaller screen sizes for sidebar (overlapping elements)
- better animation on hover of top bar
- changes to the search bar
- better alignment formatting of new message composer elements (to: from: etc)

Still-Broken things:
- layout icon selection
- much of the mobile view
- the left/right alignment of icons at the bottom of the new-message composer

At this point in time the code is not organized, but in the future this code might be maintained/organized.
